# Exprestimate

This is the final project for my C++ class. This is a mental game that tests your ability to quickly estimate increasingly complex expressions. General game play involves a user being given an arithmetic expression which must be estimated to within 10%. The amount of terms and their complexity depends on the level you are currently on. An increase in level corresponds to an increase in the number of terms in the expression or increases the maximum for the range for the terms value. Below is an example of some expressions in increasing order of difficulty.

1 + 2
2 - 3 * 4
14 + 8 * 11
20 / 12 + 4 - 15
...

Note that order of operations must be respected in these calculations.

Enjoy!
